    "\n",
    "First we do the following two steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1) For each row we find its minimum point and we subtract it from all the other points in that row (including itself)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now we do the same thing for columns. Find the minimum value of each column and subtract that value to each value in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps may be repeated\n",
    "\n",
    "3) \"Cover\" all the 0's in the resulting matrix using the minimum number of horizontal and vertical lines. If n lines are required, an optimal assignment existamong the 0's and the algorithm stops. If less then n lines are required, continue with Step 4\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Find the smallest element that is not covered by a line in step 3. Subtract k from all uncovered elements and add k to all elements that are covered twice. Go back to step 3"

    "\n",
    "Subtracting the minimum value in each row and column transforms the matrix so that the lower bounds of the costs are adjusted to zero. This operation maintains the relative differences between the costs, which is critical because the relative differences determine the decision of assignment. The transformation does not change the optimal set of assignments because it’s a consistent reduction across each row or column—think of it as recalibrating the matrix to a new baseline where the lowest possible cost starts at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Cover the Zeros?: The goal here is to find a combination of rows and columns such that all zeros are covered and the number of covering lines is minimized. If the number of lines used to cover the zeros equals the number of rows or columns, then the optimal assignments can be made directly from the zeros that are not intersected by multiple lines. Each zero that isn't intersected represents a possible assignment of a job to a worker at no additional cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Adjust the Matrix This Way?: This method systematically exposes more zeros in the matrix while maintaining the integrity of the relative cost structure. By making these adjustments, the algorithm incrementally steps closer to finding the minimum cost assignment."
